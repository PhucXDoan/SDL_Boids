# SDL\_Boids

An SDL implementation of boids.

To build, the development library of SDL2 is required in order to perform linking.
A folder named `SDL2` at the root directory of the project is needed.
The folder should contain the `include` and `lib` folders from the extracted development libary.
Use `W:\misc\shell.bat` to initialize the development environment and `W:\misc\build.bat` to build with `msvc`.
