# SDL\_Boids

An SDL implementation of a simulation of boids. The project depends on SDL2. The development libraries can
be downloaded from their site. Extract and place `include` and `lib` into the `W:` directory of the project
so the build can link against the SDL libraries and header files and so the program can also find the `.dll`.
Initalization of the shell can be done through `W:\misc\shell.bat` and building with `W:\misc\build.bat` using
`cl`.
